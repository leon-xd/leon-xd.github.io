                    <h3>Software Engineering Intern for XP Power Team</h3>
                    <p>
                        My second internship at Microsoft involved building an internal tool for the Cross-Platform
                        Power Team.
                        For this tool, I designed and implemented a pipeline that synthesized and analyzed data
                        involving High-Power Scenarios from devices that were under development.
                        To complete my project, I had to learn a multitude of internal tools and frameworks.
                        I developed primarily using C#, utilizing OOP to write extensible code that the team still uses
                        today.

                        My first internship at Microsoft involved automating a key part of the Devices manufacturing
                        testing procedure.
                        By utilizing OpenCV and Python, I was able to build a program that automated keyboard backlight
                        testing for quality assurance.
                        I also designed and implemented a user interface for my program using the Tkinter library.

                        Elected Board (E-board) of 12 people through an entire year of the club.
                        The club had grown to a size larger than ever, with over 90 people, nine year-long projects, and
                        four semester-long projects.
                        As president, I managed roles overseeing projects, tutorials, finances, outreach, recruitment,
                        internal logistics, social events, and marketing through weekly meetings.

                        <li>
                            During our tenure as Presidents, we managed the planning and hosting of two external
                            Showcases at the end of each semester, where we showed off progress on our projects in a
                            beginner-friendly manner.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We also utilized connections throughout industry in order to obtain Makers' first corporate
                            sponsorships: we recieved donations from Microsoft and Qualcomm.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Utilizing our connections throughout USC, we were able to acquire our first independent
                            storage space on campus. This led to the creation of a new E-board role in order to manage
                            the space we were allocated, which was also ideated and executed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Additionally, we coordinated with alumni and industry connections to host four Design
                            Reviews for projects throughout the year.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The beginning of each semester drove us to manage a two-step recruitment
                            process involving all of E-board, allowing over 30 more Makers to join the club.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We also managed the cultivation of our tight community, where we held over 20 social events
                            to encourage Makers to socialize.
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        Being at the head of an organization that produced 13 hardware projects with a headcount of over
                        90 people was an absolutely incredible experience to have as an undergrad.

                        Getting a glimpse at what leadership means in both an engineering context and an interpersonal
                        context helped me grow immensely, and I can now truly say that I love building and growing
                        organizations because of my first-hand experience.

                    <h3>Director of Membership</h3>
                    <p>
                        As the Director of Membership of Makers my junior year, I had a few responsibilities to handle.
                        First, I had to lead two recruitment cycles involving all of E-board to let new members into the
                        club.
                        Second, I had to onboard and represent the new members as they got acclimated to the club.
                        Third, I was in charge of DEI efforts for Makers leadership.
                        Fourth, I was in charge of organizing the process of gaining feedback from all members of the
                        club after each semester.
                        Finally, I acted as the point person to resolve interpersonal conflicts within the club's
                        membership and leadership, and was one of the key people in charge of maintaining the Makers
                        community during the virtual semester.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I worked as hard as I could to make sure that my impact on my job went above and beyond what was
                        expected of the role.
                        To start, I completely overhauled the old process of recruitment by focusing on standardizing
                        the recruitment process as much as possible.
                        This came in the form of several improvements through the review of application & interview
                        portions of recruitment.
                        First, I separated E-board reviews into separate spreadsheets so that user bias would not be
                        affected.
                        Second, I wrote a rubric for the application process.
                        Third, I changed the rhythm of interviews to give feedback before discussing with other E-board
                        members.
                        Fourth, I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/leon-xd/bias_visualizer" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener noreferrer">Python script to attempt to negate grader bias</a> during the
                        application phase.
                        Finally, I specified and delineated what values we were looking for in potential Makers to
                        assist us in making judgements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to recruitment, I expanded the other areas of my role as well.
                        I started an anonymous feedback form so that members of the club could provide feedback to us
                        without risking their personal identity.
                        Additionally, I started an annual DEI seminar for leadership (all Project Managers and E-board)
                        to ensure that everyone was operating with values that are key to the smooth operation of the
                        club.
                        Finally, I helped to plan, film, and host our club's Spring Showcase, which was streamed live on
                        YouTube to a large virtual audience.

                    <p>
                        The work that I did this year was extremely gratifying, as holding the community together during
                        the virtual school year was a challenging yet necessary problem to solve.
                        This year taught me how difficult it is to manage and cultivate a community, and it helped me to
                        get introduced to leadership in order to progress through to my next role in Makers.

                        For the web development, I helped interface with a web development contractor by developing a
                        Figma board, and managing their requirements list for their website.
                        For the curriculum development, I helped to develop slides on topics that were related to Python
                        data science libraries.
                        I developed & presented slideshows on introductory Python, Matlab, Pandas, Numpy, and Keras.

                    <h3>Software Engineering Intern</h3>
                    <p>
                        Davenport Aviation is a company based in Columbus, OH that has an expertise on exporting plane
                        parts for foreign airlines.
                        My responsibility was twofold: developing a Power BI to further develop their KPI interface, and
                        developing an extension to a service that updates lists of plane parts available via a
                        third-party inventory software API.
                        I revamped their KPI while developing business knowledge surrounding the indices that I was
                        revamping, feeding my curiousity for business and allowing me an inside window into high-level
                        business processes.
                        In addition, to update the automated service for inventory management, I utilized the Java
                        SpringBoot framework, alongside Selenium webscraping, multi-threading, and OOP principles.

                    <p>
                        DataEmerge is a small business based out of Columbus, OH that focuses on data migration for
                        hospitals.
                        I used C# to develop a testing tool for the data migration software, and learned the Angular.js
                        framework in order to build a small worker productivity internal tool.
