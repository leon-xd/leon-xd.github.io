                    <p>
                        This page is dedicated to the technical projects that I have spent time working on outside of
                        jobs.
                        Many projects come from the club that I was a part of in college,
                        <a href="https://viterbimakers.usc.edu/">USC Makers</a>, while others come from class projects.
                        For more on my leadership roles in Makers, please refer to the experience section of my website.

                    <h1>Crani-Arm</h1>
                    <h2>Aug 2021 - May 2022</h2>
                    <h3 class="margin-top-1em">Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        The goal of Crani-Arm was to use
                        <a href="https://www.ourpcb.com/emg-sensors.html">sEMG sensors</a> to detect finger motion and
                        replicate it in a robotic hand.
                        I was on the software team for this project, where we were responsible for creating the ML
                        models, creating a testing framework, and collecting data.
                        The hardware team was responsible for collecting and processing the sEMG signals, and
                        actuating the servos which controlled the robotic arm.
                        The mechanical team was responsible for designing and fabricating the mechanical hand which
                        would eventually replicate the movements we desired.
                        This was my final Makers project, and was the largest project that I have embarked on.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Testing Procedure</h3>
                    <p>
                        The first thing that we did to demonstrate the power of our EMG sensors was to build a demo that
                        could demonstrate the responsiveness of sEMGs. To do this, we developed a clone of the game
                        "Flappy Bird" using pygame that used signals from the sensors to tell the bird when to jump.
                    </p>

                        height="480" allow="autoplay"></iframe>
                    <p>
                        Next, for the collection of data we needed automatic detection of hand position. Using the
                        mediapipe library, we were able to determine hand position through our laptop camera. This
                        helped us to automatically label training data for our machine learning algorithms.
                    </p>
                    <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P2ZSNSSPeYM4ffQPnvfXY7C7Sju9oMB6/preview" width="640"
                        height="480" allow="autoplay"></iframe>
                    <p>
                        The next thing we had to do was collect data. By synchronizing data from our EMG sensors and
                        camera data, we developed a script to synthesize training datasets.
                    </p>
                    <h3>LSTM Training</h3>
                    <p>
                        By splitting our datasets into training & testing sections, we trained neural networks to
                        recognize and predictively label the specific hand motions.
                        To accomplish this, we used the Tensorflow library for model development, along with
                        scikitlearn, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.
                        Initially, we attempted to determine a binary
                        "open/close" for each finger, but we quickly realized that our dataset did not have a high
                        enough resolution to predict so many potential combinations.
                        We moved towards recognizing specific, pre-determined hand positions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the model, we decided to use a LSTM (Long short-term memory) network, which is a stateful
                        recurrent model that is great for time-series data. During the process of training we spent a
                        long time shifting parameters to determine what the best combination of parameters to predict
                        the data would be.

                    <h3>Video Demo</h3>
                    <p>
                        For our final demonstration, we used the LSTM to recognize hand positions from Rock Paper
                        Scissors, and programmed the hand to always beat the user at the game.

                    <h3 class="margin-top-1em">Overview</h3>
                    <p>
                        Not all projects are destined to succeed, and nothing taught me that more than my work on
                        Robodog.
                        This was my Makers project during the second semester of my Junior year, which was a
                        semester that was still online due to COVID.

                        The project's scope was incredibly large: we wanted to build a functioning robotic dog Ã  la
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFuA50H9uek&ab_channel=BostonDynamics">Boston
                            Dynamics</a> that could walk and be controlled via an XBOX controller.
                        A project that is this large, understaffed, and almost completely virtual is naturally doomed to
                        fail, and although we didn't deliver on our original scope, I learned an incredible amount
                        through the process of trying to create the robotic dog.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Software</h3>
                    <p>
                        Through an open source project called
                        <a href="https://spotmicroai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Spot Micro</a>, we were able to base our
                        code off of an existing repository.
                        Setting this repository up and thorougly understanding the software behind it allowed me to be
                        exposed to Raspberry Pis, ROS, and the Pybullet simulation library.
                        In addition, hacking into an XBOX controller allowed me to familiarize myself with Bluetooth and
                        Linux.
                        I was able to successfully set up the software onto our robot, when we realized that there were
                        problems with the mechanical assembly that unfortunately involved superglue, so my work could
                        not progress any further.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Electrical</h3>
                    <p>
                        Because I was a team member in Los Angeles at the time that could
                        work on the robot in person, I was also in charge of electrical assembly.
                        This involved figuring out how to hook up a 12V battery to power a servo board with 12 different
                        servos and a Raspberry Pi operating at different voltages.
                        This allowed me to understand voltage regulators, and understand practical knowledge about
                        stable current draw from batteries and the necessity of using proper gauged wires.
                        Although I'm not sure this would be very hard for an electrical engineer, this was a great
                        extension of my robotics knowledge from high school.

                    <p>
                        This project's objective was to build a robotic arm with a light attatchment at the end.
                        We programmed it to move so when you took a long-exposure photograph of the arm, it would
                        produce a stunning image.
                        This team worked remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, and I was on the software team.
                        My responsibilities included writing software to modularize the stepper motor movement,
                        and writing code to produce images.
